Viverra Sem suscipit

Viverra Sem suscipit is my html/css project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program. It consists of one index page and one post page, and is my very first work online.

Motivation

2020 is the year that I started programming, and it has been a real fun journey to use completely new AND powerful tools to think and to create work.

Credits & Inspirations

Fontawesome provides icons, Lipsum provides text, Lorem Picsum provides hipster photos, and Pravatar provides a face.

Jeremy Keith's blog (adactio.com) has been my go-to blog whenever I have questions about coding for blogs. I also discovered monokai.nl/ and resilientwebdesign.com on his blog, both links I put on my project; the latter is his web book, which I finished reading in one go.

I looked at Medium.com to understand their design logic; I also found out later that my 10px-gap design detail is kinda similar to NYT.com's, which was unintentional.

Thanks for stopping by! For Udacity reviewers, thanks for reviewing my code!
